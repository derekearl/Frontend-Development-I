            White Space is also known as negative space is the empty space that we see on a website.
            This can be handy is using slick, yet functional elements of a page.  It can also reduce 
            the amount of text that people will see at once.  A good example of this is Apple's website.
            The use of negative space is well put and it looks professionally done.

            If you are familiar with photography then you will be familiar with the rule of thirds.
            Think of a screen divided into thirds with a grid, so if you like grids a lot, then using Rule
            of Thirds is probably the best thing for you.  A good example of a website using this is Playstion
            due to the fact that there are multiple pictures being used and it makes it easy on the eyes.

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
        </div>
        <p>YouTube</p>

        <p>
            So Hick's law and Fitt's law are almost the same thing. I chose Hick's law because basically lets
            the user make a decision. For example, all of the videos that are displayed on YouTube make it so that
            the user can easily make the choice they want, and it makes it user-friendly as well.
